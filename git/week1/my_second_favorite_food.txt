Nettle Porridge with pearl barley and black pudding.
A bunch of young stinging nettles ( roughly 150 – 200gms)
6 tablespoons of oatmeal
3 tablespoons of pearl barley
400ml – 500ml of vegetable stock (we used Boullion vegetable stock)
100g’s of black pudding (you can replace black pudding with bacon, salami or pepperoni)
20ml of olive oil or butter
Add olive oil or butter to a pre-heated pot or pan. 
 Place the black pudding onto the heat and fry until done.  
 Remove the black pudding and leave to one side. 
  Add the vegetable stock and bring to a gentle boil, add washed nettle leaves to the pot. 
   Simmer for about 5 minutes.  
   Remove the nettles from the pot, chop into smaller pieces and leave to one side. 
    Add the pearl barley to the pot of vegetable stock and nettle liquid. 
    Simmer for a further 15 minutes or until the pearl barley is soft yet chewy.  
    Add the oatmeal to the pot and cook for another 5-7 minutes. 
     Stir in the chopped pre-cooked nettles and black pudding to the pot and allow to stand for a minute or two.  
     Serve in a bowl with crusty bread!
