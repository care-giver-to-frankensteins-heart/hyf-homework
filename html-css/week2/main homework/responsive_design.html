          <h2>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
          <p>
            Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a
            growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by
            businesses wishing to use their webiste to sell products and
            services to customers.[1]
          </p>
          <p>
            There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB,
            GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack.
            This has kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum.
            Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been
            the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as
            Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio.
            Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language(HTML) or of programming
            languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can
            be learned and implemented quickly with the help of help files,
            technical books, internet tutorials, or face-to-face training.
          </p>
          <p>
            An ever growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers
            build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers
            now help to deliver applications as web services which were
            traditionally only available as applications on a desk - based
            computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize
            information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the
            rise of cloud servies such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and
            Google Docs. These web services allow users to interact with
            applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a
            specific workstation for their application environment.

            <h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h3>
            <p>
              Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce
              led by web development include e-commerce. Online auction sites
              such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase
              goods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and
              Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the shopping and
              bargain - hunting experience for many consumers.
